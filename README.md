Matching-cards
==============

Show card images by tracing the area on which mouse is clicked and check match with previous image clicked

Use your computer mouse to click on a card and flip it over. Click on another card to try to find its match. Remember as many cards as you can to finish the game quickly because if the next card you flip matches the first card, the two cards will disappear from the pool and you are closer to victory!
